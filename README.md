# RandomTwitter

Random writer algorithm applied to twitter feeds

Should take a twitter user,
read some number of their tweets
create a dictionary of their verbage etc
create a new random tweet based off of the random writter pattern

## Roadmap:

1.  Get writer working (done!)
2.  Get twitter API to feed into this
3.  Wrap it in a UI on the internet
4.  post to reddit
